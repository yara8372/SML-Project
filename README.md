Repository for the group project in the course Statistical Machine Learning

Project Description: The problem is to classify the gender of the two main actors (one male, one female) in Hollywood movies. The training set consists of 1037 films and a test set of 387 films. We were expected to (i) try some (or all) classification methods from the course (like logistic regression, discriminant analysis: LDA, QDA, K-nearest neighbor, Tree-based methods: classification trees, random forests, bagging, and Boosting) and evaluate their performance on the problem, and (ii) make a decision which one to use and ‘put in production’ against a test set.
